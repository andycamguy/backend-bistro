# What am I doing?
- I really am not sure. I am on the island from Castaway with a bunch of sharks out in the sea wherever I look.

# Requirements/Rubric
For this project, we will be creating a simple Python/Django API to serve as the backend for our previously created React Restaurant frontend app. 
Create the models, views, and database for an API that provides READ operations for a userâ€™s restaurant items in a PostgresQL database. 
The app should be able to perform READ ONLY operations on the Restaurant models as well as have routes to display information as JSON.
## Tech Stack
